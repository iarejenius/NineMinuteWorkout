# Nine minute workout
I came across [this](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/strength-training-plyometrics) workout in the NYTimes -- it's great for getting in a quick workout without any equipment. 
The tricky part for me was remembering the order of the workouts and keeping track of the time. So, I created this simple mobile app that announces each activity when it's time to do that activity.

## Pre-requisites
[Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) with [Visual Studio Tools for Xamarin](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/) installed. 

## Deployment
Since this is a personal project, I don't deploy this to any app store. I use the [SignAndroidPackage](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/xamarin/} build target, upload the `.apk` to something like Google Drive, and then access the `.apk` file on my phone to install. This requires that [your device be set up for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/set-up-device-for-development).
